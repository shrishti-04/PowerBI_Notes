<H1>Power BI Notes</H1>
<p>In this repo I will cover Power BI concepts which will include functions of Power Query, DAX Queries, Graphs, Charts, UI/UX, way of presentation and more.</p>

<H2>Power Query</H2>
<p>Power Query is a data connection and transformation tool in Power BI, Excel, and other Microsoft products that allows users to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources. 
It provides a user-friendly, no-code interface for cleaning and reshaping data before loading it into a data model.</p>

<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Data Connectivity:</b> Connects to multiple data sources (Excel, SQL, APIs, etc).</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Data Transformation:</b> Cleans and reshapes data (removing duplicates, merging tables, etc).</p></li>
  <li><p>Updates data automatically when sources change.</p></li>
  <li><p>M Language (M Code):</b> Uses a formula language for advanced data transformation.</p></li>
</ul>

<H3>Data Connectors / Data Extraction</H3>

<p>You can connect your data along with IBM server, Python, BigQuery, etc.
Here are some common examples</p>

<p>You can extract any datasets in power query using get data options, following it browsing your datasets from your respective folders.</p>

<p>After which you will get the preview of your datasets and you need to click on transform data.</p>
